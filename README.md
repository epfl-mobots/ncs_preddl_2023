# This repository contains the data used in the manuscript entitled **_"Predicting long-term collective animal behavior with deep learning"_**

It contains data of pairs of _Hemigrammus rhodostomus_ (Rummy-nose tetra) swimming in a circular arena (25cm radius).

- `rummy`: Contains the pair data for _H. rhodostomus_
- `generated`: contains the data generated by the models presented in "Predicting long-term collective animal behavior with deep learning".

If you are using this dataset you can reference its DOI.
